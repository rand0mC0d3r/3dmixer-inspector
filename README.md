# A-Frame-Touch-Inspector (WIP)
##### Based on A-Frame Inspector (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector)

### üìù Inherited documentation

Previous documentation can be found here: [A-Frame Inspector](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector/blob/master/README.md)

The foundation, event sending and mechanics along with processing and exporting functions were mainly preserved, yet refactored to feature components described as functional entities.
